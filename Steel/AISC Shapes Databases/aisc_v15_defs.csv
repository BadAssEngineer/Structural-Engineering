EDI_ STD_ Nomenclature,"The shape designation according to the AISC Naming Convention for Structural Steel Products for Use in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)- June 25- 2001. This information is intended solely for the use of software developers to facilitate the electronic labeling of shape-specific data and electronic transfer of that data."
AISC_  Manual_ Label,"The shape designation as seen in the AISC Steel Construction Manual- 15th Edition.  The exception to this is the designation for double angles. There is a separate listing (row) for each back-to-back spacing and configuration. Therefore- the shape designation reflects these two variables. The listings for double angles follow the convention specified in the AISC Naming Convention for Structural Steel Products for Use in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)- June 25- 2001.
T_F,Special notes,W-shapes- a value of T for- tf > 2 in.,M-shapes- a value of T indicates that the shape has sloped flanges.,WT-shapes- a value of T for- tf > 2 in,MT-shapes- a value of T indicates that the shape has sloped flanges.  "
