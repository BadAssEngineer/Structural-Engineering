# Structural-Engineering
Structural Engineering Modules (Python 2.8 primarily)

Structura Beam
Continous Beam Analysis based on the 3 Moment Method
Tkinter GUI Based Python program that generates text and DXF files for the analsis results.
Note does not account for patterning of transient loads. Is dependant on the two gif files being present as they are used in the 
Tkinter GUI

Concrete T beam
Tkinter GUI based Python program.
Provides various code defined capacities based on strain compatibility. Currently based on ACI 318-08. Calculates elevation
of various steel reinf. layers based on clearance and spacing requirments per ACI 318-08.

Concrete T Beam Any Steel
Tkinter GUI based Python program
Provides various code defined capacities based on strain compatibility. Allows for user assigned elevations of steel reinforcement
layers. Does not check or provide for min spacing of tension layer bars nor maximum amount of bars that fit in a layer.
