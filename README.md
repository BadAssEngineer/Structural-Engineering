Structural Engineering Modules (Python 2.7 primarily)

Concrete T beam - depend on concrete_beam_classes
Tkinter GUI based Python program.
Provides various code defined capacities based on strain compatibility. Currently based on ACI 318-08. Calculates elevation
of various steel reinf. layers based on clearance and spacing requirements per ACI 318-08.

Concrete T Beam Any Steel - depend on concrete_beam_classes
Tkinter GUI based Python program
Provides various code defined capacities based on strain compatibility. Allows for user assigned elevations of steel reinforcement
layers. Does not check or provide for min spacing of tension layer bars nor maximum amount of bars that fit in a layer.

Three Moment Method
Contains a class for the Three Moment Method for conitnous beam analysis.
